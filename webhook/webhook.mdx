## What are webhooks

It is an event-driven approach that ensures a service provider can send the right notification to the right external services at the time it occurs. In another way, it is a machine to machine architectural pattern that enables a client API to receive updates to data as they happen, rather than polling for the latest updates.

## How it works

When an event is fired inside Price Edge that a webhook is registered to, a request will be sent to the registered endpoint with the following signature

``` Http
PUT {api_url}/api/system/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "externalUrl": "https://webhook.site/3431a3c0-a123-4e24-9bbc-5ae0acf780d9",
    "sharedSecret": "bamboo", //any text, it will be used in the signature
    "eventType":"change",
    "eventSource":"pepe", //pepe, table
    "eventSourceObject":"NextRRP", //pepe (price) column or table name
		"includeData": false, //optional; true/false
}
```


## List registered web hooks

``` Http
GET {api_url}/api/system/webhooks
```

## Unregister web hooks

``` Http
DELETE {api_url}/api/system/webhooks/{ID}
```

## Test web hooks

This will simulate a change in the object it is registered to. It could mean that other hooks registered to the same event will also receive a ping *(this behaviour will change in the future to only send the notification to this specific webhook)*

``` Http
POST {api_url}/api/system/webhooks/{ID} 
```
